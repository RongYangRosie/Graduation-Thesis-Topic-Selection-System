# Graduation-Thesis-Topic-Selection-System
## Background:

In order to digitize the management of school graduation theses and address issues like inconvenient and slow information transmission in the past, such as students being unable to submit thesis-related documents due to their absence from campus, and the tedious task of individually notifying students by colleges or supervisors to arrange work. This system enables network-based management, facilitating teachers and students, and improving work efficiency and effectiveness.

## Functional Module Division:

This system can be divided into three modules: Administrator module, Student module, and Teacher module.

b. Student user management: Allows administrators to manage student users, including viewing, modifying, and deleting student information. Ensures data consistency by deleting related tuples in other tables.

c. Teacher user management: Allows administrators to manage teacher users, including viewing, modifying, and deleting teacher information. Ensures data consistency by deleting related tuples in other tables.

d. Student topic viewing: Allows administrators to view the topics chosen by students.
